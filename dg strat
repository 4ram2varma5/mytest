Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for migrating away from Azure Synapse (formerly known as Azure SQL Data Warehouse) would typically focus on aspects such as migration progress, performance, cost efficiency, and data integrity. Here are some KPIs you might consider:

Migration Progress Metrics:

Percentage of Data Migrated: Measure the percentage of data that has been successfully migrated from Azure Synapse to the new platform.
Number of Components Migrated: Track the number of databases, tables, stored procedures, and other components migrated to ensure comprehensive migration coverage.
Migration Timeline: Measure the time taken to complete different stages of the migration process to ensure it is within the planned timeline.
Performance Metrics:

Query Performance: Measure the query execution times on the new platform compared to Azure Synapse to ensure there are no significant performance regressions.
Data Load Speed: Measure the speed at which data is loaded into the new platform compared to Azure Synapse to ensure efficient data ingestion.
Cost Efficiency Metrics:

Infrastructure Cost: Compare the cost of infrastructure (compute, storage, networking) on the new platform with Azure Synapse to ensure cost efficiency.
License Costs: If applicable, track any licensing costs associated with the new platform compared to Azure Synapse.
Data Integrity and Security Metrics:

Data Consistency: Monitor data consistency and integrity during and after the migration process to ensure there is no loss or corruption of data.
Compliance and Security: Ensure that the new platform meets the necessary compliance requirements and provides adequate security controls compared to Azure Synapse.
User Satisfaction Metrics:

User Feedback: Gather feedback from end-users regarding their experience with the new platform compared to Azure Synapse.
User Adoption Rate: Measure the rate at which users adopt the new platform and their satisfaction levels.
Downtime and Disruption Metrics:

Downtime Duration: Measure the duration of any downtime or disruption caused by the migration process to minimize business impact.
Number of Incidents: Track the number and severity of incidents encountered during the migration process to identify areas for improvement.
Data Governance Metrics:

Data Quality: Monitor data quality metrics (e.g., completeness, accuracy, consistency) on the new platform to ensure data governance standards are maintained.
Data Accessibility: Ensure that data remains accessible and available to authorized users after the migration.
By tracking these KPIs, you can effectively monitor the progress and success of your migration away from Azure Synapse and identify any areas that require attention or optimization.
